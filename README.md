This is a course project in Udemy, The Complete React Developer Course(w/ Hooks and Redux) by Andrew Mead.
I will personally recommend this course to you if you are a Front-end rookie and needs to get your first step.
You can view the website by https://react-expensify-coursera.herokuapp.com/

# If you want to view and run it locally
Clone the file and install NPM or Yarn. Run "npm install" or "yarn install". Then choose NPM or Yarn to do "run dev-server"

# Future changes
I will try to rewrite the project without Firebase.
